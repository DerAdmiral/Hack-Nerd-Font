Probably is this me just beeing stupid, however as tried to setup the "Hack Nerd Font" on my desktop pc for my terminal and nvchad, I 
noticed that for some reason inside nvchad the glyphs weren't displayed correctly. This caused some confusion because 
in the terminal everything looked okay and seemed to work. Apparently the 
"new" Hack Font (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack) is different from the one 
I use on my laptop (I've installed this version on my laptop like one year ago and I dont remeber where i got i from... :) ).
So for everyone experiencing the same issue, I've uploaded the files I use on my laptop here so you can install it. 
(for instructions on how to, please refer to your os/dist docs).

!!!
I dont give any warranty, dont take any responsibility, and more important this font is not my work (I've just permanently borrowed it)
